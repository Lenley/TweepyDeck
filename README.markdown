TweepyDeck
===========

TweepyDeck is currently an experimental PyGtk client for Twitter.


To run it you'll just need to execute the `tweepydeck` script

    % ./tweepydeck 


Why are you asking for my password?
--------------------------------------
I'm not particularly sold on using OAuth with Twitter, 
while it is convenient when you're working with web applications
it's unpleasant (in my opinion) when building a desktop
application.

Yes, TweepyDeck does prompt for your password but the 
application is using SSL for every API call that uses 
your password.
